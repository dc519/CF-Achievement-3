## Overview

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictional movie rental company that previously had stores around the world. Facing competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the company's management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a database. Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any business questions that other departments may have.

## Key Questions

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
